# External Services Status

## Payment Functionality: DISABLED ❌

The payment functionality has been commented out and disabled across the application.

### What was commented out:
- ✅ Backend Razorpay integration (`utils/razorpay.js`)
- ✅ Payment API routes (`routes/oauth.js`)
- ✅ Frontend payment component (`components/payment/RazorpayPayment.jsx`)

## Google OAuth Functionality: DISABLED ❌

The Google OAuth functionality has been commented out and disabled to prevent interference with other web applications.

### What was commented out:
- ✅ Backend passport.js and session middleware in `server.js`
- ✅ Google OAuth strategy and routes
- ✅ Frontend Google OAuth component (`components/auth/GoogleOAuth.jsx`)
- ✅ Google OAuth credentials in `.env` file

### Files modified:
1. **Backend:**
   - `server.js` - Passport imports and middleware commented out
   - `utils/razorpay.js` - All Razorpay functions commented out
   - `routes/oauth.js` - OAuth routes and payment routes commented out
   - `.env` - OAuth credentials and payment keys marked as disabled

2. **Frontend:**
   - `components/auth/GoogleOAuth.jsx` - Shows "Google OAuth Disabled" message
   - `components/payment/RazorpayPayment.jsx` - Payment logic commented out, shows disabled message

### Current behavior:
- **Authentication:** Traditional email/password registration and login only
- **Payment:** Payment buttons show "Payment Disabled" message
- **OAuth:** Google OAuth button shows "Google OAuth Disabled" with gray styling
- **System:** No external service dependencies, preventing conflicts with other applications

### To re-enable services:
1. **For Payments:**
   - Uncomment code in payment-related files
   - Replace placeholder API keys in `.env` with real Razorpay credentials
   - Test the payment flow end-to-end

2. **For Google OAuth:**
   - Uncomment passport and session imports in `server.js`
   - Uncomment OAuth routes and middleware
   - Uncomment Google OAuth credentials in `.env`
   - Update frontend GoogleOAuth component to restore functionality

**Note:** The core bidding and auction functionality still works perfectly. Only external service integrations are disabled.
